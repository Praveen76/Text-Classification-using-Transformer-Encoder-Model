# Text Classification using Transformer Encoder Model

This repository focuses on text classification using a Transformer Encoder model, utilizing the IMDB dataset for experimentation.

## Learning Objectives

By exploring this repository, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

- Understand the big picture of transformers and their significance in natural language processing tasks.
- Gain familiarity with the Textvectorization layer, which converts raw text into numerical representations suitable for deep learning models.
- Work with the embedding layer, which maps words to dense vectors in a continuous space, capturing semantic similarities between words.
- Understand the concept of self-attention, a key mechanism in transformers that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence during processing.
- Explore transformer encoder architecture and positional embedding, which helps the model understand the sequential order of words in the input.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Text-Classification-using-Transformer-Encoder-Model.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Text-Classification-using-Transformer-Encoder-Model
    ```

3. Follow the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to understand and experiment with text classification using the Transformer Encoder model.
